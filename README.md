## Background

This library implements BLS over the alt-bn128 curve in Solidity. SolBLS performs well,
according to [RFC 9380](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9380).
It implements the recommended `expand_msg_xmd` algorithm for hashing a bytestring to an element of
the field, and likewise hashing a bytestring to a pair of elements in the field. To convert these
field elements to curve elements, it implements the Shallue-van de Woestijne encoding, which is
constant time and relatively economical to execute on-chain.

It's meant primarily for on-chain verification of signed messages produced by [Sylow](https://github.com/warlock-labs/sylow),
for use in [Warlock](https://warlock.xyz)'s data feeds.

It's an amalgamation of several repositories, all of which seem to be based
on [this article](https://ethresear.ch/t/bls-signatures-in-solidity/7919).
The library here is based upon [kevincharm](https://github.com/kevincharm/bls-bn254/tree/master)'s version, but actually
this
exists in many versions:

- https://gist.github.com/kobigurk/257c1783ddf556e330f31ed57febc1d9
- https://github.com/ralexstokes/deposit-verifier/blob/8da90a8f6fc686ab97506fd0d84568308b72f133/deposit_verifier.sol
- https://github.com/kilic/evmbls/blob/master/contracts/BLS.sol
- https://github.com/thehubbleproject/hubble-contracts

## Features

- Efficient implementation of BLS signatures
- Compliant with RFC 9380
- Optimized for on-chain execution
- Implements Shallue-van de Woestijne encoding for constant-time operations
- Supports single signature verification

## Usage

Import the BLS library in your Solidity contract:

```solidity
import "solbls/BLS.sol";
```

Example usage:

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    using BLS for *;

    function verifySignature(
        uint256[2] memory signature,
        uint256[4] memory pubkey,
        uint256[2] memory message
    ) public view returns (bool) {
        // First, check if the signature and public key are valid
        require(BLS.isValidSignature(signature), "Invalid signature");
        require(BLS.isValidPublicKey(pubkey), "Invalid public key");

        // Hash the message to a point on the curve
        uint256[2] memory hashedMessage = BLS.hashToPoint("domain", abi.encodePacked(message));

        // Verify the signature
        return BLS.verifySingle(signature, pubkey, hashedMessage);
    }
}
```

For more detailed usage examples, please refer to the test files in the `test/` directory.

## Security

This version of the contract does not implement point compression or subgroup membership checks. While relatively safe
on BN254, the reliance on the pre-compile to catch malformed keys may or may not have been intentional from the original
Solidity implementation.

Key security considerations:

- Lack of explicit subgroup membership checks could potentially introduce vulnerabilities in certain scenarios.
- The library relies on precompiles for key validation, which may have implications for gas costs and security.

For more details on security considerations, please refer to the `audits` folder.

## Install

This module depends on [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/). Make sure you have it installed before proceeding.

```bash
forge install warlock-labs/solbls
```

## API

The main functions provided by the BLS library include:

- `verifySingle`: Verify a single BLS signature
- `hashToPoint`: Hash a message to a point on the BN254 G1 curve
- `isValidSignature`: Check if a given signature is valid
- `isValidPublicKey`: Check if a given public key is valid

For detailed API documentation, please refer to the comments in the `BLS.sol` file.

## Testing

To run the tests for solbls, use the following command:

```bash
forge test
```

The tests cover various aspects of the library, including signature verification, point hashing, and input validation.
For a detailed breakdown of test coverage, please refer to the `test/` directory.
